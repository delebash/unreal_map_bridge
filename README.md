# Unreal Map Bridge

Front end app for UnrealMapboxBridgePlugin https://github.com/delebash/UnrealMapboxBridgePlugin for Unreal. Import heightmaps into Unreal from real world locations using Mapbox or Maptiler

The web app can be used without the Plugin.  It just creates and downloads heightmap images to your computer. You can manually import these images into Unreal using the Landscape Tools.  The plugin part just automates the import into Unreal for convenience

New map web application replacing my previous UnrealMapboxBridge web app.
